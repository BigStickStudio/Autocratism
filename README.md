# Autocratism
An proposal for a new form of anarcho-libertarian-socialism with democratic foundations, protecting against oligarchical totalitarianism.
Manifesto for a Decentralized, Self-Governing Community

## Preamble
We, the people, establish this manifesto to guarantee the universal right to freedom, self-regulation, and self-determination. We recognize the necessity of self-honesty, integrity, and mutual respect as the foundation of a thriving society. Our commitment to equity, equality, and contribution ensures that every individual has the opportunity to prosper according to their effort, merit, and ability to persevere. This constitution safeguards against any form of exploitation and ensures that all contributions are valued fairly, while always upholding the rights of others.

## Article I: Structure and Governance
### Decentralization:
Our society is composed of autonomous, self-governing communities. Each community operates independently through collective decision-making and mutual aid, with no centralized authority ruling over the whole.

### Direct Democracy with Freedom of Others in Mind:
Decisions are made by community members through direct participation. Assemblies guide the community’s direction, with all members having an equal voice. No decision may impose on the freedom of others.

### Leadership Based on Merit and Integrity:
Administrative and organizational roles are rotated, but positions of responsibility should prioritize the most qualified individuals over the most popular or well-funded. Individuals in roles of authority are prohibited from enacting policies or regulations that serve private profit or self-interest. Success and prosperity are tied directly to one’s contribution, ability to persevere, optimize, maintain, and save resources for the benefit of the community.

### Avoidance of Power Consolidation and Self-Serving Policies:
No individual or group may establish rules that are self-serving or intended for privatized profit when dealing with public roles or sectors. Individuals who serve the community must do so with fairness and transparency. Their prosperity must reflect their true contributions and efforts to improve the well-being of the whole. Any form of manipulation or exploitation for personal gain will be strictly prohibited.

## Article II: Roles and Responsibilities
### Community Assemblies:
The governing body of each community is its assembly, open to all members for participation. These assemblies decide on resource management, policy, and major community initiatives through transparent and fair processes.

### Working Groups with Transparency and Openness:
Specialized working groups manage specific areas like education, healthcare, and production. To avoid gatekeeping or stagnation, all groups must remain open to new ideas and contributors. They must not become self-serving or reject innovation that threatens the status quo. Profits from these activities must be secondary to their impact on the community and individual well-being.

### Incentivized Roles Based on Contribution:
Leadership and coordination roles must be incentivized by the actual impact and contribution they provide to the community. These roles are not to be held for personal gain but must reflect an individual’s merit and effort. Any failure to fulfill these responsibilities equitably will result in rotation or removal by the community.

### Conflict Resolution and Mediation:
Conflict resolution councils, composed of rotating community members, handle disputes and grievances using restorative justice principles. These councils must act impartially and resolve conflicts without favoring any individual or group.

## Article III: Operations and Resources
### Voluntary Contribution with Focus on Results:
Contribution to the community is voluntary, but priority is given to those who contribute most effectively to the collective. The completion of community objectives and the results of efforts take precedence over public opinion or popularity. Those who demonstrate skill and dedication to completing goals are acknowledged and rewarded.

### Resource Allocation with Self-Sufficiency and Balance:
Resources are distributed fairly but are not allocated to promote a welfare state or create a dependency on handouts. Instead, the emphasis is on self-sustaining groups, open to all, and the freedom to claim exemption. Priority access to resources is given to those who contribute meaningfully to the whole, but contributions are not mandated. This ensures fairness while maintaining individual freedom and autonomy.

### Mutual Aid for Collective Well-Being:
Communities prioritize mutual aid but ensure that individual rights and needs are balanced against the well-being of the entire collective. Programs should enhance sustainability and individual freedom, ensuring people are not coerced into participation or exploited by mandated programs.

### Sustainability and Transparency:
The community shall operate sustainably, ensuring that resources are managed with care and transparency. All decisions regarding resource allocation are made openly, with input from the entire assembly.

## Article IV: Rights of the People
### Freedom of Choice and Action:
Every individual has the right to freely choose how to participate in community life. No person may be forced or coerced into action or contribution against their will.

### Dignity, Equity, and Karmic Justice:
All individuals are equal and entitled to respect, equity, and fair treatment. Actions will have karmic consequences, meaning individuals must face the outcomes of their choices, whether positive or negative. Exploitation, injustice, and manipulation of others will not be tolerated. Justice is served as a natural consequence of one's actions.

### Right to Prosper by Contribution:
Individuals have the right to prosper according to their contributions and efforts. No one will prosper at the expense of another’s freedom or well-being. Programs that mandate participation will be designed to avoid exploiting individuals or forcing them into involuntary service.

### Right to Participate and Hold Power Accountable:
Every individual has the right to participate in decisions that affect them. Those in positions of authority must be accountable to the community, and all individuals have the right to challenge decisions that harm the collective or exploit resources.

## Article V: Defense Against Oligarchy
### Power Rotation to Prevent Entrenchment:
All roles of influence must rotate frequently. No individual or group may hold power for long enough to entrench themselves or consolidate control.

### Accountability for Damages and Harm:
Individuals or groups that cause harm to others or the collective will be held accountable to an extent equal to the damage caused. Any abuse of power, mismanagement, or corruption will face proportional consequences, ensuring justice and fairness are upheld.

### Vigilance Against Corruption and Exploitation:
Community members are tasked with remaining vigilant against corruption, elitism, and power grabs. Any individual found exploiting the system for personal gain will be removed from positions of authority and face community justice.
